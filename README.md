# Modeled the Electric Field Intensity in an n-layer SPR sensor
This are the results of my summer 2019 project on SPR sensors under Dr. Akhilesh Kumar Mishra, assistant professor of physics at IIT Roorkee.
I modeled the Electric field intensity inside a multi-layer SPR sensor.
For developing the necessary thought process, I plotted various precursor graphs characteristic of SPR sensors.
